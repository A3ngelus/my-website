        <h2>Death Knight</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Origin: The term Death Knight was formally introduced in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition, 1975).</li>
            <li>
            Lore: Created by evil gods (often Demogorgon), death knights are fallen paladins who betrayed their oaths
            and were cursed with undeath.</li>
            </li>
            <li>
                Abilities: They can cast dark spells, control undead, and wield cursed weapons.</li>
            <li>
                Purpose: Serve as high-level villains, symbolic of divine punishment and corruption.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Paladin</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Created by Gary Gygax, based on Roland and the knights of Charlemagne. They were introduced in Dungeons & Dragons (1st Edition) as a Lawful Good holy warrior. </li>
        <li>Unlike the Death Knight, the orignal paladin was designed to be a player character not a NPC, or non-playable character.</li>
        <li>While they were supposed to be "Champions of justice, purity, and divine law" later editions gave the paladin more flexibility allowing players to have darker and/or more violent characters, examples of these include Oath of Vengeance and Oathbreaker paladins.
