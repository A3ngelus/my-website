                <h3>Blood</h3>
                <p class="tank">Forged in shadow and risen from death, Blood Death Knights thrive where others fall.
                    Drawing power from blood magic and necrotic resilience, they twist pain into strength, binding their
                    flesh with unholy will. In the heart of battle, they are immovable — siphoning life from foes and
                    standing unbroken against the tide. With each heartbeat, they drain their enemies to sustain
                    themselves, wielding massive weapons with crushing force and unrelenting resolve.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Frost</h3>
                <p class="dps">Born of death and bound by ice, Frost Death Knights are the embodiment of winter’s wrath.
                    With runeblades crackling with freezing energy, they strike with lethal precision and ruthless
                    efficiency. Their presence chills the air, their blows slow the heart — and their enemies are left
                    frozen, shattered, and forgotten. Masters of dual-wielded devastation or two-handed annihilation,
                    they unleash bursts of unstoppable damage, controlling the flow of battle with unrelenting speed and
                    supernatural chill.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Unholy</h3>
                <p class="dps">Rot. Decay. Unrelenting dread. Unholy Death Knights are not warriors — they are
                    apocalyptic forces made flesh. Wielding pestilence as a weapon and commanding legions of the dead,
                    they spread corruption with every blow and turn the battlefield into a writhing charnel ground.
                    Infused with necrotic energy, they wear down foes with diseases, shadow magic, and undead
                    monstrosities — including the ever-loyal ghoul at their side, ready to tear flesh from bone. As
                    their power grows, so too does the plague… until everything dies.</p>
