1. At smaller screen sizes (starts at 450px), the nav bar and the header start to fall out of the viewport. It is recommended to have your website look good at sizes as small as 350px, so a media query at around 450px that either shrinks the header and navbar or something like that would help to fix this issue across all the pages.

1a. Added media query at 450 to fix this issue, but on my screen I could not replicate the issue. 

2. On the Paladin and Death Knights page there are images that shrink slowly to match the size of the viewport. This works great on both pages till around 700px where it gets hard to see and then eventually is unidentifiable. Either making the image larger so it maintains a good size until 350px or a media query that makes it larger at around 700 should fix this.

2a. Images now scale at 40%, was 25%. 

3. This is very much personal preference, but I like the death knights and paladin page's padding a lot. The fact that the padding on the footer, nav, and header match and then the flex boxes are slightly further away from the edge of the viewport looks great. I also like how the title of the content in each flexbox is outside and that there is good spacing. If you did this on the other pages, for example the Dungeons and Dragons page, the website will be more coherent. 

3a. Moved the h2 element outside the content section in both pages.
