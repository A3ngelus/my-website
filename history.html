    <h2>Paladin history and historical context</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The word "paladin" comes from the Latin palatinus, meaning "of the palace" (i.e., a high-ranking noble).</li>
    <li>In medieval French literature, paladins were the 12 legendary knights of Charlemagne, the king of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor (8th-9th century). While paladins are largely a romanticized invention, they are rooted in real medieval knighthood and Christian warrior ideals. From the Chansons de Geste ("Songs of Deeds") - epic French poems from the 11th-13th centuries.</li>
    <li> Fictional accounts include: Roland's tale in The Song of Roland shows him as brave, loyal, and divinely favored. Also, from the Chansons de Geste ("Songs of Deeds") - epic French poems from the 11th-13th centuries.</li>
    <li>Knights Templar and Hiispitallers</li>
    <li> Another important part of the paladin is the Chicalric Code or Oath. This includes ethics that the paladin must live by, honor, loyalty, and faith This has influenced fantasy writing to make the paladin a divinely empored knight of virture.</li>

    <h2>Death Knight History and historical context</h2>

<ul>
    <li> II (1995) to present: First game appearance. Gul'dan creates death knights by binding the souls of necromancers to fallen knights. In World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (2008), the lore was further expanded. Death knights are created by the Lich King, often raised from fallen heroes. Roleplayer characters often use the follwoing themes for their characters; corrupted heroism, loss of free will, redemption, and necromantic power.

    </li>
    <li>
        Within fantasy novels two stand out the most: Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melniboné (1960s-70s): Influenced dark antihero archetypes—cursed knights with sentient weapons and J.R.R. Tolkien's Nazgûl: whiile not called death knights, butthey do share traits—once noble kings, now undead, armored, and enslaved.
    </li>
    <li> Themes come from medieval legends like the Black Knight, and undead warriors like the Draugr from Norse myth or revenants from European folklore.
